# Hello, I'm @londer1! 👋

Welcome to my digital corner! If you love tech **and** cats, you're in the right place. (Yes, that's a picture of a cat hilariously pushing a bowl of water in its face on my profile)

💻 **Who Am I?**

I'm passionate about all things about computers, from writing code to physically building machines. I love building PCs and know a lot about components from CPUs to GPUs and everything in between.

---

🔐 **On the Horizon:**  
Im most likely heading most to **cybersecurity**. Its cool to be allowed to hack ethically and other things.

🌱 **Currently Exploring:**  
JavaScript is my current playground, where I’m diving deep into learning it, and how to use it a good way. But don’t be surprised if you catch me talking about the latest hardware releases.

🤝 **Open for Collaboration:**  
If you're into building websites, interested in tech, or want to discuss cool ideas about software **or** hardware, let’s create something together!

---

📫 **Reach Out:**  
Feel free to drop me a message on Discord! Whether it's tech talk, PC builds, cat memes, or just hanging out, I'm always up for a good chat.

Thanks for stopping by, and remember, tech is always better with a bit of curiosity (and cats).
